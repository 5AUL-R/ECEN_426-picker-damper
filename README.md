# ECEN_426-picker-damper
Repo for all materials for a novel design for a mechatronic chordophone picker and damper mechanism for ECEN 426

## Picking mechanism ideas
- string cutting (and realoading?) mechanism
- Variability of electrical noise over pickups:  
Seperate stepper over the pickups?  
Potentially designing a picker wheel that allows the distance betwen the pickups and the stepper to be varied?  
Moveable shielding?  
- Picker wheel that can fan in and out

## Damper mechanism ideas
- compliant mechanisms? 
- scissor lift
- novel materials?
